    This is the official repository for creating an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system implementation involving state-based models. In this project, the task is to create an algorithm that will automatically solve a grid-based puzzle called "Sokoban". This is a classic Japanese game created by Horiyuki Imabayashi and was first published by Thinking Rabbit in 1981. &#129302;
